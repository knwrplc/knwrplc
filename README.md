- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @knwrplc
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code, machine learning in particular. I also like coffee and it so happens that at this moment I`m working as a barista.
-  Horror games are the best cause they give me some intense emotions. Resident Evil and phasmophobia are my favourite games atm. I love Charlotte Bronte, I've read all her books.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me :
- inst knwrp1c
- telegram knwrplc
- discord knwrplc
